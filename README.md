# nxrmqlly.github.io - demos and stuff

This just serves as an index for my demos and (some) projects.

It's just a no-bs no-stylesheet website, my actual pretty website is on [my personal website](https://ritamdas.vercel.app/)

If you find any discrepancies or have any suggestions, open a PR/Issue or email me at `ritamdas[at]duck[dot]com`
